The API used for this app is: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun

The site is called "Pagan Rage Cocktails" and can be found at this URL: https://paganrage-cocktails.onrender.com/

The website is an interactive cocktail database that allows users to search through cocktails by name, ingredient, or liquor preference. Users are able to "like" a drink which adds the drink to a collection of their liked drinks. 
The website utilizes login/logout/signup features, search forms/results, and a user's collection of drinks. I chose these features because I want the experience to be more personal than a standard list of recipes, I think that storing a collection of preferences makes the user experience more appealing.

The website homepage presents a "Drink of the Day" that pulls a random cocktail from the API on each page load. Users can click on this drink, or utilize any of the three search functions. In order to save a drink, users must sign up and login.
