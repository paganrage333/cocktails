I will use this API: https://apilist.fun/api/the-cocktail-db which will allow users to search based on the name of the drink, the ingredients, or category of drink. They will also be able to view a full list of the drink, or just generate a random selection. 
	The schema might look something like this:

Tables

1. Users
   - `user_id` (Primary Key)
   - `username`
   - `email`
   - `password_hash` (for security)
   - Other user profile information (e.g., name, age, etc.)

2. Flavors
   - `flavor_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name` (e.g., sweet, sour, spicy, fruity, etc.)

3. Liquors
   - `liquor_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name` (e.g., vodka, rum, gin, whiskey, etc.)

4. Cocktails
   - `cocktail_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `instructions` (how to make the cocktail)
   - `image_url` (URL to an image of the cocktail)
   - Other cocktail details (e.g., glass type, garnish, etc.)

5. Ingredients
   - `ingredient_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name` (e.g., lime juice, simple syrup, soda, etc.)

6. Dietary Restrictions
   - `restriction_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name` (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)

7. User Dietary Restrictions
    - `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
    - `restriction_id` (Foreign Key to DietaryRestrictions)

Relationships

 A User can have multiple Dietary Restrictions (many-to-many relationship with UserDietaryRestrictions).
 A Cocktail can have multiple Ingredients, Flavors, and Liquors (many-to-many relationships with CocktailIngredients, CocktailFlavors, and CocktailLiquors).
A Cocktail can be associated with multiple Users who like it or have saved it as a favorite (many-to-many relationship not explicitly shown in the schema).


	Potential issues would be handling invalid search terms or dietary restrictions and of course the overall reliability of the API and things like rate limiting, changes to the API, cost of use, etc. There is sensitive information in this project, regarding a userâ€™s login credentials, as well as their personal preferences and dietary restrictions. 
	The user flow and functionality would look something like
